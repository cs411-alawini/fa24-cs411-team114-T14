## Project Summary

The Country Pollution App aims to analyze and visualize various data points such as land size, population, GDP, and carbon emissions for different countries. By evaluating this information, users can understand how their country performs in terms of pollution and carbon footprint. This app will serve not only residents seeking awareness about their countryâ€™s environmental status but also tourists looking for healthier travel destinations, particularly those sensitive to pollution-related health issues.
